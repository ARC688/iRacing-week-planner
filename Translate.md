Help me translate!

Unfortunately I'm only bilingual in programming languages, so if you can help at all
in translating the UI of the week planner, make a copy of translations/en.js and 
translate what you can. If you're happy with git and github, send me a PR, but if
you're not comfortable with that, send it to me on Twitter or email.

Priorities are Spanish, Italian and German.
